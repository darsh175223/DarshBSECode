# Object Detection with Machine Learning on a RaspberryPi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
  
During the first week, I tried to connect the raspberry pi wirelessly through puTTy since I didn't have the suitable cable yet. When I received the cable I was able to use the raspberry pi terminal through Visual Studio Code or VNC viewer. Using VNC viewer I was able to power up the camera that I connected to my raspberry pi. And I used Visual Studio Code to run python scripts. I used Visual Studio Code to run machine learning models and the camera.

# Second Milestone
  
During the second week, I used Visual Studios Code to run python to capture an image through the raspberry pi. I then ran the image through a machine learning model to identify what object it was. Then I modified it so that the python code captures the image contsantly thus acting as a live feed. Then I tweaked the script such that the camera would take a picture if the camera was covered by detecting darkness. This image would be run through a machine learning code and would spit out the most likely object. I then modified it further such that it gives a QR Code that you can scan and direct the user to a Wikipedia link about the object.
