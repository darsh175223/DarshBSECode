# First Milestone
  
During the first week, I tried to connect the raspberry pi wirelessly through puTTy since I didn't have the suitable cable yet. When I received the cable I was able to use the raspberry pi terminal through Visual Studio Code or VNC viewer. Using VNC viewer I was able to power up the camera that I connected to my raspberry pi. And I used Visual Studio Code to run python scripts. I used Visual Studio Code to run machine learning models and the camera.
